# Flags Of The World - Memory Card Game #

## Introduction ##

Flags of the world is the second of four projects that i will be completing as part of my diploma with Code Institute. 

The aim of the game is for players to turn cards over two at a time and to try and find a matching pair. When a player has found all of the matching pairs of cards then the game is over. The aim of the gam is to achieve this in as few attempts as possible.

There are 3 difficulty levels a player can choose.


Easy - Players will be given 90 seconds to complete the game<br>
Medium - Players will be given 60 seconds to complete the game<br>
Hard - Players will be given 30 seconds to complete the game<br>
